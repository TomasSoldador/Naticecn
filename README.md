# **NativeCN App**

This project was developed to explore and experiment with the [NativeCN](https://github.com/nativecn) library, combined with [NativeWind](https://www.nativewind.dev/), for building modern and reactive interfaces in **React Native** applications.

## **Project Objective**
The main objective of this project is to study and understand how the **NativeCN** library works, evaluating how it can be integrated into future projects. During this study, **Expo** and **NativeWind** were also used for efficient styling, compatible with the React Native ecosystem.

## **Features**
- Demonstration of an interface set up with **NativeCN**.
- Integration with **NativeWind** for dynamic styling.
- Display of a fictional profile with adjustable preferences.
- Support for **Dark Mode** with dynamic switching.

## **Technologies Used**
- **React Native**: Framework for building mobile applications.
- **Expo**: Tool to accelerate development and testing.
- **NativeCN**: Library for simplifying the creation of native components.
- **NativeWind**: Tailwind CSS extension for React Native.
- **TypeScript**: Programming language for static typing.

## **How to Run the Project**
1. Make sure you have **Node.js** and **Expo CLI** installed:
   ```bash
   npm install -g expo-cli
   ```

2. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/TomasSoldador/Naticecn.git
    cd Naticecn
    ```

3. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. Start the app with Expo:
    ```bash
    expo start
    ```

5. Scan the QR Code with Expo Go or run the app on an emulator.

## **Lessons Learned**
- **NativeCN** provides a solid approach to building native interfaces, focusing on performance and simplicity.
- **NativeWind** integrates smoothly with the React Native ecosystem, enabling responsive styling using classes similar to Tailwind CSS.
- Using **TypeScript** improves the development experience by providing type safety.

## **Next Steps**
The knowledge gained from this project will be applied to future development, especially for creating more advanced and optimized interfaces. NativeCN will be considered a key solution for building native UIs due to its simplicity and flexibility.
